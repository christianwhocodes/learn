In Flexbox, items are aligned on a single axis. It is often described as being **one-dimensional**. While you can set the main axis to arrange items as rows or columns, flexbox only deals with one dimension at a time.

Grid layouts are thought of as **two-dimensional** because it can arrange items into rows and columns at the same time.
