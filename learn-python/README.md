## 🏋️ Exercise Structure

Each module with exercises includes three types of files:

- **`*-start.[ext]`**: Starting template with task descriptions and hints
- **`*-work.[ext]`**: Your workspace to complete the exercises
- **`*-end.[ext]`**: Complete solution for reference

### How to Use Exercises

1. Open the `*-start.[ext]` file to see the tasks
2. Work in the `*-work.[ext]` file (this is your practice space)
3. Check your work against `*-end.[ext]` when done

**Note**: The `*-work.[ext]` files are gitignored by default, so your practice work stays local.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [LANGUAGE] [version] or later
- [LANGUAGE] [recommended version]+ recommended for modern features
- [Any additional tools or dependencies]

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/learn-[language].git
   cd learn-[language]
   ```

2. Start with the [Introduction](./01-Introduction.md)

3. Follow the modules in order

4. Complete the exercises for hands-on practice

## 💡 Tips for Learning

- **Practice regularly**: Code every day, even if just for 15 minutes
- **Type the code**: Don't just read - type out the examples yourself
- **Experiment**: Modify examples to see what happens
- **Use the documentation**: [LANGUAGE] has excellent documentation at [official docs URL]
- **Complete exercises**: Hands-on practice is essential
- **Join communities**: Ask questions and learn from others
